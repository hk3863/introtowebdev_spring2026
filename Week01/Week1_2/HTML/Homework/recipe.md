# Recipe for Tteokbokki - Spicy Korean Rice Cakes (Serves 2)

## Description
Tteokbokki is a classic Korean street food made with chewy rice cakes simmered in a bold, spicy-sweet gochujang sauce. It is comforting, satisfying, and known for its glossy red sauce and addictive texture.

## Ingredients
- Korean rice cakes (tteok): 300 g (cylindrical *garaetteok*), fresh or soaked if frozen
- Fish cakes (eomuk): 100–150 g, sliced
- Water or anchovy–kelp stock: 2 cups
- Onion: ¼ medium, sliced
- Green onion: 1 stalk, cut into 4–5 cm pieces
- Optional: boiled egg, cabbage, ramen noodles

### Sauce
- Gochujang (Korean red chili paste): 2 tablespoons
- Gochugaru (Korean chili flakes): 1 tablespoon (adjust to taste)
- Soy sauce: 1 tablespoon
- Sugar: 1–1½ tablespoons
- Minced garlic: 1 teaspoon

## Method
1. If using frozen or hardened rice cakes, soak them in warm water for 10–15 minutes.
2. In a wide pan or pot, add the water (or stock), gochujang, gochugaru, soy sauce, sugar, and garlic. Stir well and bring to a gentle boil.
3. Add the rice cakes, fish cakes, onion, and cabbage (if using). Simmer over medium heat.
4. Stir frequently to prevent sticking. As the rice cakes soften, the sauce will thicken—about 8–10 minutes.
5. Add green onions and optional boiled eggs or noodles. Cook 2–3 more minutes until glossy and thick.
6. Taste and adjust sweetness or heat. Serve hot.

### Key Principles
- Balance heat, sweetness, and savoriness; street-style tteokbokki is intentionally bold.
- Stir regularly to keep the sauce smooth and prevent scorching.
- Thickness should coat the rice cakes, not pool at the bottom.
