        <h1>Heading 1 is the most important text on the page. This is usually a
            marketing tagline or company name or pagge title. ONLY ONE h1 per page!
        </h1>
        <h2>Heading 2 - you can have as many h2s-h6s as you want on the page</h2>
        <h3>Heading 3 - Think hierarchy. WHat text is more important?</h3>
        <h4>Heading 4</h4>
        <h5>Heading 5</h5>
        <h6>Heading 6</h6>

        <p>Most of the text/content of your page will probably be inside p tags. 
            Try not to have text in your body without tags.</p>

            This is text without a tag. Avoid this! There is no way for me to change the appearnce of this text.

            <p>Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. 
                Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, 
                when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type
                specimen book. 
                <em>This text is an em text
                </em>
                <strong>This is the strong tag. There is also a bold tag but bold is a word
                    that describes how it looks, not info about the text </strong>
                It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into 
                electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. <br /> We just used a break tag inside a paragraph.
                It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets
                containing Lorem Ipsum passages, 
                and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including 
                versions of Lorem Ipsum.</p>
